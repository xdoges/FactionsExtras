# FactionsExtras
*Supplies in-demand features for factions servers*

Being dissatisfied with the current state of public faction server cores, I decided to write my own. FactionsExtras is built with modularity in mind, and plans to have at least 10 common features found on modern  day factions servers.  

### Features

### Development Builds
You can compile this project yourself by running:
```$xslt
git clone https://github.com/xdoges/FactionsExtra.git
mvn clean install
```

Or you could just head over to my [CI server](https://ci.doges.me/job/factionsextras) and download JARs from there.

For fully tested versions, there will be a [Spigot Resource entry](https://spigotmc.org) once I am satisfied with the state of this project.

### Support
If you encounter any issue using this plugin, just [open an issue.](https://github.com/xdoges/factionsextras/issues) I'm happy to help.

### Contribution
Pull requests and issue reports are always appreciated.
